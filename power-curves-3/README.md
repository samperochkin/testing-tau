# Important note

Due to a recent cleanup of the repository, running the code will require
updating some of the paths in the files of this folder.
Most importantly, the paths in the scripts that read:
  "sim/sim-main/powerCurves/pre-computed/..."
  "sim/sim-main/powerCurves/functions/..."
  "sim/sim-main/powerCurves/results/..."
will now need to updated to
  "power-curves/pre-computed/..."
  "power-curves/functions/..."
  "power-curves/results/..."
This means you might also need to create these folders.
